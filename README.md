# Student-Examinaion-Assistant
SEA is a desktop app written in Visual Basic intended to solve the problem of students  writing examination code on paper
It was created as a final year project for my Degree.
It was hosetd on a free platform so it might be dead when you see this but the code and solutions work perfectly
